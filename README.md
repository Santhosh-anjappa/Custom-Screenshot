# Custom-Screenshot
Snipping tool application in Python

# Problem :
1. While making a test document, <br>
  a. user has to take screenshot of the evidance in application<br>
  b. and paste it in the document.<br>
  c. process invovle switching between atleast three different windows (in most case more than three)<br>
 <br>

2. This application runs in background<br>
  a. on pressing prtscr button on keyword the snipper is invoked and allows user to choose the part of screen, which the user wants.<br>
  b. immediately after choosing editor window opens and user can make highlighter marks, and add comment.<br>
  c. onclicking save the screenshot is added to the MS Word document along with comment added by the user in previous step.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
  With this application user need not switch back and forth among various windows while taking screenshots for evidance documentation.
  All can be done by just 
  <br>
  <b>pressing prtscr->choosing screen area->add comment
  <br>
  screen shot and comment will be automatiocally added to Word document.
